I had trouble because I kept getting this /Users/pam/Desktop/Assignment_2_user_Interactions/.venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/urllib3/__init__.py:35: NotOpenSSLWarning: urllib3 v2 only supports OpenSSL 1.1.1+, currently the 'ssl' module is compiled with 'LibreSSL 2.8.3'.

  I updated my software and the versions on all my environments, and was not able to get my metrics up and running on time.
